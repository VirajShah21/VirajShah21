2. üçé [Hi MVC](https://github.com/VirajShah21/Hi) ‚Äì A framework for building user interfaces using state management. Hi is a model-view controller which creates UI components similar to that of macOS and iOS, with similar alignment and out-of-the-box features as AppKit and SwiftUI.
3. üßÆ [LeetCode (Java)](https://github.com/VirajShah21/LeetCode-Java) ‚Äì The repository which houses all of my LeetCode solutions written in Java.
4. üñº [React Gallery](https://github.com/VirajShah21/ReactGallery) ‚Äì A gallery which includes reusable React components (written in TSX, transpilable to pure JS).

5. [Resumator](https://github.com/VirajShah21/Resumator) ‚Äì A resume generator. Simply fill out all of your information or connect your LinkedIn account so we can pull your information for you.

If you do not like the theme, change up the colors to your liking. Still don't like your resume? Simply select another template. Fill your information once, and try out as many resumes as you would like.
