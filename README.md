## Personal Projects

> These projects are organized starting from my best work

1. 💪 [Flex Browser](https://github.com/VirajShah21/FlexBrowser) – A simple web browser with a simple user interface, but packed with features. Allows for bookmarking, viewing history, managing windows, local storage, built-in password manager with Keychain access, and a whole bunch of customization features.
2. 🍎 [Hi MVC](https://github.com/VirajShah21/Hi) – A framework for building user interfaces using state management. Hi is a model-view controller which creates UI components similar to that of macOS and iOS, with similar alignment and out-of-the-box features as AppKit and SwiftUI.
3. 🧮 [LeetCode (Java)](https://github.com/VirajShah21/LeetCode-Java) – The repository which houses all of my LeetCode solutions written in Java.
4. 🖼 [React Gallery](https://github.com/VirajShah21/ReactGallery) – A gallery which includes reusable React components (written in TSX, transpilable to pure JS). The purpose of this gallery is to provide a house for my components so that they can be copied, reused, and/or modified for other projects. No need to re-write complex components.
5. 📄 [Resumator](https://github.com/VirajShah21/Resumator) – A resume generator. Simply fill out all of your information or connect your LinkedIn account so we can pull your information for you. Go ahead and make any modifications you would like to your profile. After you are done, select a template and watch as all your information is perfectly fitted to the resume template. If you do not like the theme, change up the colors to your liking. Still don't like your resume? Simply select another template. Fill your information once, and try out as many resumes as you would like.


## My Spotlight

The capstone course for Computer & Information Sciences at Temple University provides us the opportunity to build a project based on our own ideas from the ground up. We work in a small team using common business practices while developing the project.

Real Time Chess is a variation of standard chess. All the pieces move in the same pattern as regular chess, but you can move as many pieces as you would like in any given turn – a player is allowed to move multiple chess pieces prior to their opponent making a move. The only limitation to this is that once a piece is moved it is will be locked for a cooldown time (default is 5 seconds). After the the cooldown period ends, the piece is unlocked and can be moved again. [Click here to check out the live site](http://rtc-capstone.herokuapp.com)
